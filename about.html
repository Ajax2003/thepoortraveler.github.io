<p>The Poor Traveler's Story</p>
</div>
<div class ="para">
<p>There was once a kid named Aj, who lived in a faraway land called the Runeterra. 
There, he dreamt of traveling the entire globe. Unfortunately, he was still young, inexperienced, and lack of knowledge. 
With this, he was motivated to succeed but managed to fail. Additionally, he tried several attempts for his studies and still fails,
 he was exhausted and decided to take a break due to a mental breakdown.  </p> 
</div>
<div class ="graph">
<p>During his mental breakdown, he remembered what his father said to him that 
"In life, we either fall or rise, you may fall and lose your power to fight, but in time, you will rise." 
With that, he stood on his feet and managed to successfully pass his studies.  </p> 
</div>
<div class ="anadawan">
<p>After he graduated, he was financially broke and was finding a way to solve his problem.
 That's where he came up with an idea, an idea that will resolve this issue. He became a vlogger,
 whose contents are about his travels around his nation at first. As time goes by, his channel grew and so did his earnings.
 Therefore, he decided to continue his dream which to travel around the globe.</p>
